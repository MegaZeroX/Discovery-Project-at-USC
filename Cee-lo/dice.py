#Create a "Die" class with the following methods:
#1) A constructor called __init__ that takes how many sides the die will have
#2) A roll method, which gets the dice
#3) A method called current_roll(), which should say what the last thing the die just rolled

#After doing the above, try testing it out! Remember to ask if you have any questions about it!

#Cool, let's try making a Dice class now!
#We will take the number of dice and the number of sides each one should have in our constructor
#I recommend using the Dice class you made and making a list of dice!
#After the constructor, we should make the following methods:
#1) A "roll_all" method which will roll all of the dice, and return a list of the numbers they output
#2) A "reroll" method which takes the index of a die to reroll and rerolls that one, returning the result
#3) A "current_roll" method which will return a list with all of the previous rolls of each die

#Again, feel free to test it out and ask for help at any point along the way! When you complete this, you can try running
#the "CeeLoGui" file to see if you successfully completed the game!
