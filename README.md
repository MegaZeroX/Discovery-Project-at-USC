Educational code for use at 2019 Summer Discovery Project

Note that the only files intended to be created by students is BJ.py and RPS.py for BlackJack and RockPaperScissors (respectively)

There is used code from other places under MIT License, and card images free for use in non-commercial applications as well

Still to do:

Oicho-Kabu

Royal Flush Checker GUI

Chess/Checkers for advanced students?

Texas Hold 'em for advanced students?

(both the above iff we do separate the advanced students from the rest)
